        <h2>Our desicions and road to migration</h2>

            <p>Our journey began in 2014 when we decided we wanted to migrate form Argentina. Our country is beautiful, and all our extended family is there, but economics, politics and security were always (and will be unfortunely) an issue to leave and raise kids. By that time, we already had two boys, so the decision was real, we wanted to move abroad.
            At first, we investigated and our points according to Canada's CRS (comprehensive ranking system) were enough for Express Entry (EE). To apply for this path, the only thing I needed to do was to validate my university degree and take an English language exam (IELTS or TOEFL).
            All this took money and time. I sent my two degrees to ICAS Canada to validate them, and pay the fee to take the IELTS exam. Unfortunelly this took months, almost a year, because the English exam was expensive and ICAS needed the University from which I did my degree to send them directly some papers. The Institution took a lot of time and almost a year and a half I finally got the credential validation. By this time, we were able to get in the EE pool and wait for our score to be nominated. A year passed and no invitation was sent. So we took a drastic decision...

            <div id="details" style="display: none">
              <p>we decided to put everything on hold and study better all our options. We read everything we could find about options to move to Canada, watched YouTube videos, follow Instagram accounts of people that already did it... and the we set a time. It was 2020, pandemic world chaos, and that was the perfect time for us to set everything on motion.
              We decided that the easiest (but more expensive) way, was by coming to study. And as we were already 'old', the CRS score was not so high and we did not get a chance to apply for EE anymore. We investigated all the programs that fit our needs best with the help of a free study agency. The program that we like the most was the Rural program. So, after doing a list of all the cities in the program, see all the work possibilities there, weather, nature, schools and some personal choices, we decide for Thunder Bay. Next step was to look for programs to study at Confederation College and Lakehead University. Finally, I decided for Conf. College and, with the help of the agency, we put together all the papers and apply for the program.
              After got admitted to college, we present every paper to IRCC for the VISAS, waited 17 long weeks... and we got approved.
